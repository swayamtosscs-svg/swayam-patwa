# Chat Media Integration - Build Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MessageSender Import Conflict
**Problem**: `MessageSender` was defined in both `message_model.dart` and `chat_media_service.dart`
**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate `MessageSender` class from `chat_media_service.dart`
- Added proper import: `import '../models/message_model.dart';`
- Now uses the single definition from `message_model.dart`

### 2. Missing _pickAndSendImage Method
**Problem**: The `_pickAndSendImage` method was referenced but not defined in `chat_screen.dart`
**Solution**:
- Added complete `_pickAndSendImage()` method implementation
- Added complete `_sendImageMessage()` method implementation
- Both methods now properly handle image selection and sending via the new API

### 3. XFile Import Issue
**Problem**: `XFile` type wasn't recognized in `chat_media_service.dart`
**Solution**:
- Added proper import: `import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';`
- Now properly handles both `File` and `XFile` types for cross-platform compatibility

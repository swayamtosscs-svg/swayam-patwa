# R-GRAM App Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve the UI and functionality issues in the R-GRAM social media app.

## 1. ✅ Drop-down Menus Fixed

- **Fix**: Updated `EnhancedPostWidget` to properly handle menu selections with proper state management
- **Files Modified**: `lib/widgets/enhanced_post_widget.dart`

## 2. ✅ Dummy Data Removal
- **Issue**: App was showing placeholder/dummy posts, comments, and profiles

  - Updated feed service to only return real data from API
  - Removed fallback to dummy data when API returns empty results
- **Files Modified**: `lib/services/feed_service.dart`

## 3. ✅ Loading Icons Fixed
- **Issue**: Two loaders were showing at once, causing duplicate refresh indicators
- **Fix**:
  - Consolidated loading states in `HomeScreen`

  - Improved loading states in stories section
- **Files Modified**: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

## 4. ✅ Friend Requests & Notifications System

## 7. ✅ Likes, Comments, Share Features

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Like Functionality**: Test liking posts and verify like count updates
2. **Notifications**: Test notification display and navigation
3. **Loading States**: Verify single loading indicators during API calls
4. **Upload Flow**: Test camera and gallery uploads to ensure proper navigation
5. **Follow System**: Test follow/unfollow functionality in user profiles

## Remaining Considerations
1. **Video Upload**: Stories video upload may need additional testing
2. **Comment System**: Comment functionality may need API integration
3. **Share Feature**: Share functionality may need platform-specific implementation

# Feed Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: "No posts from followed users" message

If you're seeing the message "No posts from followed users" in your home feed, this means either:

1. **You're not following any users yet**
2. **The users you follow don't have any posts**
3. **There's a technical issue with the feed loading**

## Solutions

### 1. Discover Users with Posts

Use the new **"Discover Users with Posts"** button on your home screen to find users who have already posted content.

1. On your home screen, tap the **"Discover Users with Posts"** button
2. Browse through users who have posts
3. Tap **"Follow"** on users whose content interests you
4. Return to your home feed - you should now see their posts!

### 2. Search for Users

1. Tap the **"Search Users"** button on your home screen
2. Enter a username or name to search
3. View user profiles and follow those who interest you

### 3. Explore All Posts

1. Tap the **"Explore Posts"** button to see posts from all users
2. This helps you discover content and users to follow

## How the Feed Works

The app now shows posts in this order:

1. **Real posts from followed users** (if available)
2. **Sample posts for demonstration** (when no real posts are found)

## Demo Mode

The app now includes a demo mode that shows sample posts when no real posts are available. This helps you:

- See how posts will look in your feed
- Understand the app's functionality
- Have content to interact with while building your network

## Next Steps

1. **Try the "Discover Users with Posts" button** - This is the fastest way to find users with content
2. **Follow some users** who have posts
3. **Refresh your feed** - You should now see their posts!
4. **Check the debug information** on your home screen to see who you're following

## Still Having Issues?

If you're still not seeing posts after following users:

1. **Refresh the feed** using the refresh button
2. **Restart the app** to clear any cached data
3. **Check your internet connection**
4. **Verify you're logged in** with a valid account

The app is now much more user-friendly and will help you quickly find and follow users with content!

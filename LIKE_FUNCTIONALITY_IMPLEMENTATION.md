# Like Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented comprehensive like functionality for user posts in the R-Gram app. Users can now like and unlike other users' posts, with real-time updates to like counts and visual feedback.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Service: `lib/services/user_like_service.dart`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated service for handling user post likes
- **Features**:
  - `likeUserPost()` - Like a user post
  - `unlikeUserPost()` - Unlike a user post  
  - `toggleUserPostLike()` - Toggle like/unlike based on current state
  - `getUserPostLikeStatus()` - Get current like status for a user
  - `getUserPostLikeCount()` - Get like count for a post
  - `getPostLikers()` - Get list of users who liked a post

### 2. Updated API Service: `lib/services/api_service.dart`
- **Added Methods**:
  - `likePost()` - Like a post via API
  - `unlikePost()` - Unlike a post via API
  - `togglePostLike()` - Toggle like/unlike
  - `getPostLikeStatus()` - Get like status
  - `getPostLikes()` - Get post likes with pagination

### 3. Enhanced Post Widget: `lib/widgets/enhanced_post_widget.dart`
- **Updates**:
  - Added support for both Baba Ji posts and regular user posts
  - Integrated `UserLikeService` for regular user posts
  - Updated `_loadLikeStatus()` to handle both post types
  - Updated `_handleLike()` to work with both post types
  - Like button now shows for all posts (not just Baba Ji posts)
  - Real-time like count updates

### 4. Regular Post Widget: `lib/widgets/post_widget.dart`
- **Updates**:
  - Added like functionality with `UserLikeService`
  - Added like button to post actions
  - Added `_handleLike()` method
  - Real-time like count updates
  - Visual feedback for like/unlike actions

## API Endpoints Used

### User Post Likes
- **Like Post**: `POST http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/posts/{postId}/like`
- **Unlike Post**: `POST http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/posts/{postId}/like` (with action: "unlike")
- **Get Like Status**: `GET http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/posts/{postId}/like-status`
- **Get Post Likes**: `GET http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/posts/{postId}/likes`

### Baba Ji Post Likes (Existing)
- **Like Baba Post**: `POST http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/baba-pages/{babaPageId}/like`
- **Unlike Baba Post**: `POST http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/baba-pages/{babaPageId}/like` (with action: "unlike")

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- [x] Like/unlike user posts
- [x] Real-time like count updates
- [x] Visual feedback (heart icon changes color)
- [x] Snackbar notifications for like/unlike actions
- [x] Error handling for network issues
- [x] Authentication checks

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Like button shows for all posts
- [x] Heart icon changes from outline to filled when liked
- [x] Like count displays next to heart icon
- [x] Color changes (red when liked, gray when not liked)
- [x] Smooth state transitions

### ✅ Backend Integration
- [x] Proper API calls with authentication tokens
- [x] Bearer token authentication
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] Support for both regular posts and Baba Ji posts

## Usage Examples

### In Screens
The like functionality is automatically available in:
- **Home Screen**: Uses `EnhancedPostWidget` with full like support
- **Profile Screen**: Uses `PostWidget` with like functionality
- **Any screen using these widgets**: Automatically gets like functionality

### Manual Integration
```dart
// For regular user posts
final response = await UserLikeService.toggleUserPostLike(
  userId: userId,
  postId: postId,
  token: token,
  isCurrentlyLiked: currentLikeStatus,
);

// For Baba Ji posts (existing functionality)
final response = await BabaLikeService.likeBabaPost(
  userId: userId,
  postId: postId,
  babaPageId: babaPageId,
);
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Like Functionality**:
   - Like a post and verify the heart turns red
   - Unlike a post and verify the heart turns gray
   - Check that like count updates correctly
   - Verify snackbar notifications appear

2. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Test with no internet connection
   - Test with invalid authentication
   - Test with non-existent posts

3. **Test Both Post Types**:
   - Test with regular user posts
   - Test with Baba Ji posts
   - Verify both work correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Like Animations**: Add heart animation when liking
2. **Double-tap to Like**: Implement Instagram-style double-tap to like
3. **Like Notifications**: Send notifications to post owners when their posts are liked
4. **Like Analytics**: Track like patterns and popular posts
5. **Bulk Like Operations**: Allow liking multiple posts at once

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing Baba Ji post functionality
- All API calls include proper error handling and user feedback
- The UI updates are smooth and provide immediate visual feedback
- Authentication is properly handled for all like operations
- The code is well-documented and follows Flutter best practices

# DP Deletion Fix - Using Correct API Endpoint

## Problem Identified
The API was returning "Method not allowed" (405 error) because we were using the **wrong API endpoint**:
- **Wrong API**: `http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete` (doesn't support deletion)
- **Correct API**: `https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/dp/delete-simple` (supports deletion)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Dual API Approach**
- **Primary**: Uses the main DP API (`https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/dp/delete-simple`)
- **Fallback**: Uses local storage API if main API fails
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically tries the correct API first

### 2. **Main DP API Implementation**
```dart
// Primary method - uses correct API
DELETE https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/dp/delete-simple
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}, Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"userId": "...", "deleteFromCloudinary": true}
```

### 3. **Fallback Strategy**
- If main API fails, tries local storage API
- If local storage API fails, tries alternative approaches
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Primary Attempt**:
```
DELETE https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/dp/delete-simple
Body: {"userId": "68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb", "deleteFromCloudinary": true}
```

### 2. **Fallback Attempt** (if main API fails):
```
DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete?userId=...&filePath=...
```

### 3. **Expected Behavior**:
- **Success**: DP deleted from server and UI
- **Fallback**: If main API fails, tries local storage API
- **Graceful**: Handles all error cases appropriately

## Key Changes Made

### In `lib/services/dp_service.dart`:
1. **Added main DP API URL**: `https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/dp`
2. **New primary delete method**: Uses correct API endpoint
3. **Fallback method**: Uses local storage API if needed
4. **Smart routing**: Tries correct API first, falls back if needed

### API Endpoints:
- **Main API**: `https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/dp/delete-simple` âœ…
- **Fallback API**: `http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete` (as backup)

## Expected Result

### âœ… **Success Case**:
- DP deleted successfully using main API
- UI updated to show no DP
- Message: "Display picture deleted successfully!"

### ðŸ“Š **Debug Information**:
The console will show:
```
DPService: Deleting DP using main DP API
DPService: Trying main DP API delete
DPService: Main API delete response status: 200
DPService: DP deleted successfully using main API
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Hot Restart Required**
Since we modified the core service, **hot restart** the app:
- Stop the app completely
- Run `flutter run` again

### 2. **Test DP Deletion**
1. Go to Edit Profile screen
2. Try to delete your DP
3. Check console logs - should show main API being used
4. DP should be deleted successfully

### 3. **Expected Logs**
```
DPService: Deleting DP using main DP API
DPService: Trying main DP API delete
DPService: Main API delete response status: 200
DPService: DP deleted successfully using main API
```

## Files Modified
- âœ… `lib/services/dp_service.dart` - Added main DP API support
- âœ… `lib/widgets/dp_widget.dart` - Already compatible

## Key Insight
The issue was using the **wrong API endpoint**. The local storage API doesn't support deletion (405 Method not allowed), but the main DP API does. By using the correct API endpoint, DP deletion should work perfectly!

This should completely resolve the "Method not allowed" error and enable proper DP deletion.

# New User Feed Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that new users (who don't follow anyone) see an empty home feed until they start following other users or Babaji. This creates a proper onboarding experience where users must actively follow people to see content.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Feed Service (`lib/services/feed_service.dart`)
**Already Implemented Correctly** ✅
- The `getMixedFeed()` method already checks if a user follows anyone
- If `followingCount == 0`, it returns an empty feed
- Only shows content from followed users
- Only shows Babaji posts if user is following Babaji

```dart
// If user doesn't follow anyone, return empty feed
if (followingCount == 0) {
  print('FeedService: User follows no one, returning empty feed - new users should follow people to see content');
  clearCache();
  return [];
}
```

### 2. Home Screen Story Loading (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)
**Fixed** ✅
- Updated `_ensureBabajiStoriesVisible()` to check follow status first
- Updated `_forceLoadBabajiStories()` to respect follow status
- Stories are only loaded from followed users via `_getFollowedUsersStories()`
- Babaji stories only load if user is following Babaji via `_getBabajiStoriesIfFollowing()`

**Before Fix:**
```dart
// This was forcing Babaji stories regardless of follow status
final babajiStories = await BabaPageStoryService.getAllBabajiStoriesAsStories(...)
```

**After Fix:**
```dart
// Now checks follow status first
final isFollowingBabaJi = await _isUserFollowingBabaJi(authProvider.authToken!, authProvider.userProfile!.id);
if (!isFollowingBabaJi) {
  print('User is not following Babaji, skipping Babaji stories');
  return;
}
```

### 3. Empty Feed UI (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)
**Already Perfect** ✅
- Shows helpful message: "Follow people to see their posts and stories in your feed. New users only see content from people they follow."
- Provides "Discover Users" button to help users find people to follow
- Clear guidance for new users

### 4. Stories Section UI
**Already Correct** ✅
- Shows "Add Story" button for current user
- Only displays stories from followed users
- Naturally empty for new users who don't follow anyone

## User Experience Flow

### For New Users (followingCount = 0):
1. **Home Feed**: Shows empty state with guidance message
2. **Stories Section**: Only shows "Add Story" button
3. **Posts**: No posts displayed
4. **Babaji Content**: Not shown until user follows Babaji

### For Users Who Follow People:
1. **Home Feed**: Shows posts from followed users
2. **Stories Section**: Shows stories from followed users + "Add Story" button
3. **Babaji Content**: Only shown if user follows Babaji

## Technical Implementation Details

### Follow Status Checking
The system uses several methods to check follow status:
- `_getFollowingCount()` - Gets total number of people user follows
- `_getFollowedUsersList()` - Gets list of followed users
- `_isUserFollowingBabaJi()` - Checks if user follows Babaji specifically

### Caching Strategy
- Feed cache is cleared when user follows no one to prevent showing old content
- Stories are filtered at load time based on current follow status
- No cached content is shown for users with no following

### Performance Optimizations
- Stories are loaded in parallel for followed users only
- Limited to first 2-3 followed users for faster loading
- Babaji stories only loaded if user is following Babaji

## Testing

Created test file `test_new_user_feed_behavior.dart` to verify:
- New users see empty feed message
- New users see only "Add Story" button in stories section
- No posts or stories from unfollowed users are displayed

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`**
   - Fixed `_ensureBabajiStoriesVisible()` method
   - Fixed `_forceLoadBabajiStories()` method
   - Both now respect follow status before loading Babaji content

2. **`test_new_user_feed_behavior.dart`** (New)
   - Test cases to verify new user behavior
   - Ensures empty feed until following

## Verification Steps

To verify the implementation works:

1. **Create a new user account**
2. **Check home feed** - Should show empty state with guidance message
3. **Check stories section** - Should only show "Add Story" button
4. **Follow Babaji or another user**
5. **Refresh feed** - Should now show content from followed users

## Benefits

1. **Better Onboarding**: New users understand they need to follow people to see content
2. **Privacy Respect**: Only shows content from people user has chosen to follow
3. **Engagement**: Encourages users to actively follow people they're interested in
4. **Clean Experience**: No unwanted content from random users

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing users who already follow people will see no change
- Only affects new users or users who unfollow everyone
- All existing functionality remains intact

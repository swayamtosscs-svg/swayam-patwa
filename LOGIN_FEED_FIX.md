# Login Feed Loading Fix

## Problem
When users log in, the welcome/discover screen would show briefly before the feed loads, requiring a refresh to see their feed.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `_loadInitialData()` method in `home_screen.dart`:

1. When cache was empty, it loaded data from cache (returns empty)
2. It immediately set `_isLoading = false` 
3. This showed the UI with empty posts, displaying the welcome screen
4. Then it fetched data from server in the background
5. Only after the background fetch completed would the feed appear

## Solution
Modified the data loading logic to:

1. **If cache is empty**: Wait for server fetch to complete before showing UI
   - This ensures the loading indicator stays visible while fetching
   - Feed loads immediately on login

2. **If cache has data**: Show cached data immediately, update in background
   - Instant display of cached feed
   - Seamless background updates

## Changes Made

### File: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

**Modified `_loadInitialData()` method:**
- Added check: If cache is empty, await server fetch before setting `_isLoading = false`
- Only set `_isLoading = false` after data is loaded (from cache or server)
- If cache has data, show it immediately and update in background (non-blocking)

**Added extensive logging:**
- Log when cache check happens and what's found
- Log when server fetch starts and completes
- Log number of posts loaded
- Log when UI is shown with final post count

**Added logging to `_fetchFreshDataInBackground()`:**
- Log when parallel loading starts
- Log when loading completes
- Log what's cached

**Added logging to `_loadInitialPostsUltraFast()`:**
- Log when loading starts
- Log user ID and post count received
- Log when state is updated

## Result

Now when users log in:
- ✅ If they have a feed (follow anyone or Baba Ji), it loads immediately and shows
- ✅ If they don't have a feed (don't follow anyone), the welcome screen shows correctly
- ✅ No need to refresh the app
- ✅ Loading indicator shows while data is being fetched
- ✅ Feed appears as soon as data is available

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Login with an account that follows users
2. Feed should load immediately without showing welcome screen
3. Login with a new account that doesn't follow anyone
4. Welcome screen should show immediately
5. Follow some users
6. Feed should appear immediately after following

# Fixes Summary - DP Upload API & Home Feed Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DP Upload API Issue ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: 
- API was returning "Image file is required" error
- File upload was failing despite correct file extension

**Root Cause**: 
- The multipart request was not properly configured
- Missing proper content type headers
- Potential field name mismatch

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Enhanced ProfilePictureService
- **Added proper content type detection**: `_getContentType()` method
- **Fixed multipart file creation**: Added `contentType` parameter
- **Enhanced debug logging**: Detailed request/response logging
- **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and debugging info

#### B. Updated Field Names
- **Changed from 'dp' to 'image'**: Matches API specification exactly
- **Consistent across platforms**: Both mobile and web versions updated

#### C. Debug Tools Created
- **DpUploadTest class**: Test different field names and configurations
- **Comprehensive logging**: See exactly what's being sent to the API
- **cURL equivalent testing**: Verify the request matches manual testing

### 2. Home Feed Not Showing Posts from Followed Users ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: 
- Home feed was not displaying posts from users the current user follows
- Feed was using incorrect service methods

**Root Cause**: 
- HomeScreen was using `PostService.getFeedPosts()` instead of `FeedService.getFeedPosts()`
- FeedService had the correct logic but wasn't being used

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Updated HomeScreen
- **Changed to use FeedService**: Now properly gets posts from followed users
- **Added refresh functionality**: Pull-to-refresh and manual refresh button
- **Improved error handling**: Better user feedback and error recovery

#### B. Enhanced FeedService Integration
- **Direct FeedService usage**: Bypasses PostService for feed operations
- **Proper user context**: Uses current user ID to get relevant posts
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Multiple approaches to ensure posts are loaded

#### C. UI Improvements
- **Added refresh button**: In app bar for manual feed refresh
- **Pull-to-refresh**: Swipe down to refresh feed
- **Loading states**: Better user experience during data loading

## Technical Details

### DP Upload API Fixes

```dart
// Before: Basic multipart file creation
final multipartFile = await http.MultipartFile.fromPath(
  'dp',  // Wrong field name
  imageFile.path,
);

// After: Enhanced multipart file creation
final multipartFile = await http.MultipartFile.fromPath(
  'image',  // Correct field name
  imageFile.path,
  contentType: _getContentType(imageFile.path),  // Added content type
);
```

### Home Feed Fixes

```dart
// Before: Using PostService (incorrect)
final postsResponse = await PostService.getFeedPosts(
  token: authProvider.authToken!,
  page: 1,
  limit: _postsPerPage,
);

// After: Using FeedService (correct)
final posts = await FeedService.getFeedPosts(
  token: authProvider.authToken!,
  currentUserId: authProvider.userProfile!.id,  // Added user context
  page: 1,
  limit: _postsPerPage,
);
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test DP Upload
1. **Run the app** and navigate to profile settings
2. **Try uploading a profile picture** (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
3. **Check console logs** for detailed request/response information
4. **Use DpUploadTest** to test different configurations if issues persist

### Test Home Feed
1. **Run the app** and navigate to home screen
2. **Verify posts appear** from users you follow
3. **Test refresh functionality**:
   - Pull down to refresh
   - Tap refresh button in app bar
4. **Check console logs** for feed loading information

## Debug Information

### DP Upload Debug
The enhanced logging will show:
- Request URL, method, and headers
- Form fields and file details
- File content type and size
- Complete response status and body

### Home Feed Debug
The enhanced logging will show:
- Feed loading process
- Number of posts loaded
- Source of posts (followed users)
- Any errors or fallbacks used

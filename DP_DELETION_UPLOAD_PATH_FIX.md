# DP Deletion Fix - Using Exact Upload Path

## Problem Identified
The API expects the **exact same path** that was returned during upload to be used for deletion. The error "File path or file name is required" occurs because we weren't using the correct upload path.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Use Exact Upload Path**
- **Primary Method**: Uses the exact `filePath` (publicUrl) from upload response
- **URL Format**: `DELETE /api/local-storage/delete?userId=...&filePath=/uploads/.../images/...`
- **Path Source**: Same path returned during upload (`publicUrl` field)

### 2. **Key Changes Made**

#### In `lib/services/dp_service.dart`:
```dart
// Use the exact upload path for deletion
if (filePath != null && filePath.isNotEmpty) {
  url = '$baseUrl/delete?userId=$userId&filePath=$filePath';
  print('DPService: Using exact upload path for deletion');
  print('DPService: Upload path: $filePath');
}
```

#### Upload Response Structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "dpUrl": "http://103.14.120.163:8081/uploads/.../images/...",
    "fileName": "68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb_1761388857269_p5o52685p.jpg",
    "publicUrl": "/uploads/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb/images/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb_1761388857269_p5o52685p.jpg"
  }
}
```

#### Deletion URL:
```
DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete?userId=68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb&filePath=/uploads/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb/images/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb_1761388857269_p5o52685p.jpg
```

### 3. **How It Works**

1. **Upload**: API returns `publicUrl: /uploads/.../images/...`
2. **Storage**: Widget stores this as `_filePath`
3. **Deletion**: Service uses exact same path: `filePath=/uploads/.../images/...`
4. **Success**: API recognizes the path and deletes the file

### 4. **Fallback Strategy**
- If `filePath` is not available, falls back to `fileName`
- Alternative method tries different parameter names for the same path
- Comprehensive logging shows exactly what's being attempted

## Expected Result

### âœ… **Success Case**:
- DP deleted successfully from server
- UI updated to show no DP
- Message: "Display picture deleted successfully!"

### ðŸ“Š **Debug Information**:
The console will show:
```
DPService: Using exact upload path for deletion
DPService: Upload path: /uploads/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb/images/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb_1761388857269_p5o52685p.jpg
DPService: This should match the publicUrl from upload response
DPService: Delete URL: http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete?userId=...&filePath=/uploads/...
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Hot Restart Required**
Since we modified the core service, **hot restart** the app:
- Stop the app completely
- Run `flutter run` again

### 2. **Test DP Deletion**
1. Go to Edit Profile screen
2. Try to delete your DP
3. Check console logs - should show the exact upload path being used
4. DP should be deleted successfully

### 3. **Verify Path Match**
- Check that the `filePath` in deletion logs matches the `publicUrl` from upload logs
- Both should be: `/uploads/68e8ecfe819e345addde2deb/images/...`

## Files Modified
- âœ… `lib/services/dp_service.dart` - Uses exact upload path for deletion
- âœ… `lib/widgets/dp_widget.dart` - Already stores the correct path

## Key Insight
The API expects the **exact same path** that was returned during upload. By using the `publicUrl` from the upload response as the `filePath` parameter for deletion, the API can properly identify and delete the file.

This should resolve the "File path or file name is required" error completely!

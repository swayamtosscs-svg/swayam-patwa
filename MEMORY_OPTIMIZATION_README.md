- Implemented early return on disposal
- Better controller lifecycle management
- Memory-efficient video initialization

### 4. HTTP Client Optimization

#### Custom HTTP Client (`lib/services/custom_http_client.dart`)
- Connection pooling with max 5 connections
- Connection timeout management (10 seconds)
- Idle timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Automatic cache clearing
- Memory-efficient request handling

### 5. App-Level Memory Management

#### Main App (`lib/main.dart`)
- Integrated memory optimization service
- App lifecycle-aware cache clearing
- Background/foreground memory management
- Reduced animation durations for better performance

#### Home Screen (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)
- Limited posts in memory to 15 maximum
- Reduced posts per page from 5 to 3
- Automatic memory cleanup on dispose
- Efficient list management

## üìä Memory Usage Statistics

### Cache Limits
- **Flutter Image Cache**: 50 images, 50MB
- **Custom Image Cache**: 50 images maximum
- **HTTP Connections**: 5 maximum
- **Posts in Memory**: 15 maximum

### Low Memory Mode
- **Flutter Image Cache**: 25 images, 25MB
- **Custom Image Cache**: 25 images maximum
- **Automatic cleanup**: Every 5 minutes

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Build Time
- **Before**: 8GB heap, 4GB metaspace
- **After**: 4GB heap, 2GB metaspace
- **Improvement**: ~50% reduction in build memory usage

### Runtime Memory
- **Image Caching**: LRU algorithm prevents memory overflow
- **Video Players**: Proper disposal prevents memory leaks
- **HTTP Connections**: Limited pooling reduces memory footprint
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents memory accumulation

## üîç Monitoring and Debugging

### Memory Stats
```dart
// Get current memory usage
final stats = MemoryOptimizationService.getMemoryStats();
print('Cache sizes: $stats');
```

### Manual Cache Clearing
```dart
// Clear all caches manually
MemoryOptimizationService.clearAllCaches();

// Enable low memory mode
MemoryOptimizationService.enableLowMemoryMode();
```

### Debug Information
- Cache sizes are logged to console
- Memory cleanup events are tracked
- Low memory mode status is monitored

## üì± Platform-Specific Optimizations

### Android
- ProGuard code shrinking
- Resource shrinking
- MultiDex support
- Optimized DEX configuration

### Windows
- SSL certificate bypass for development
- Custom HTTP client handling
- Memory-efficient image loading

## üßπ Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Always dispose controllers and listeners
2. Use the memory optimization service for cache management
3. Implement proper error handling in async operations
4. Monitor cache sizes in development

### For Users
1. Close unused tabs/screens
2. Restart app periodically for memory cleanup
3. Avoid keeping many images/videos in memory

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `FLUTTER_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION=true` - Enable all optimizations
- `FLUTTER_LOW_MEMORY_MODE=true` - Force low memory mode

### Build Flags
```bash
# Release build with optimizations
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=FLUTTER_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION=true

# Debug build with memory monitoring
flutter run --dart-define=FLUTTER_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION=true
```

## üìà Expected Results

### Memory Usage Reduction
- **Build Memory**: 50% reduction
- **Runtime Memory**: 30-40% reduction
- **Image Cache**: 50% reduction in low memory mode
- **Overall App Size**: 20-30% reduction with ProGuard

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster App Launch**: Reduced memory allocation
- **Smoother Scrolling**: Efficient list management
- **Better Battery Life**: Reduced memory pressure
- **Lower Crash Rate**: Better memory management

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **High Memory Usage**: Check if low memory mode is enabled
2. **Slow Performance**: Verify cache cleanup is working
3. **Build Failures**: Check Gradle memory settings

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check memory stats
flutter run --verbose

# Monitor memory usage
flutter run --profile

# Build with memory optimization
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=FLUTTER_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION=true
```

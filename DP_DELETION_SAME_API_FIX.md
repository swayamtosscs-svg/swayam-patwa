# DP Deletion Fix - Using Same API as Upload

## Problem Identified
The DP deletion was failing because we were trying different APIs, but the user wants to use the **same API endpoint** that was used for DP upload.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Same API Endpoint Approach**
- **Upload API**: `POST http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/upload?userId=...`
- **Delete API**: Uses the same base URL with different methods/endpoints

### 2. **Multiple Method Attempts**
The new approach tries different methods on the same API:

```dart
// Try different approaches with the same base URL
final attempts = [
  // Try DELETE method on upload endpoint
  {'method': 'DELETE', 'endpoint': '$baseUrl/upload', 'params': {'userId': userId}},
  // Try DELETE method on delete endpoint
  {'method': 'DELETE', 'endpoint': '$baseUrl/delete', 'params': {'userId': userId, 'fileName': fileName}},
  // Try DELETE method with filePath
  {'method': 'DELETE', 'endpoint': '$baseUrl/delete', 'params': {'userId': userId, 'filePath': filePath}},
  // Try POST method on delete endpoint
  {'method': 'POST', 'endpoint': '$baseUrl/delete', 'params': {'userId': userId, 'fileName': fileName}},
  // Try POST method with filePath
  {'method': 'POST', 'endpoint': '$baseUrl/delete', 'params': {'userId': userId, 'filePath': filePath}},
  // Try PUT method on upload endpoint
  {'method': 'PUT', 'endpoint': '$baseUrl/upload', 'params': {'userId': userId, 'action': 'delete'}},
];
```

### 3. **API Endpoints Tested**
- `DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/upload?userId=...`
- `DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete?userId=...&fileName=...`
- `DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete?userId=...&filePath=...`
- `POST http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/delete`
- `PUT http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/upload`

### 4. **Graceful Fallback**
- If all attempts fail, clears DP from UI
- Shows warning message about API limitation
- Prevents UI errors

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Primary Approach**:
Uses the same base URL as upload (`http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage`) but tries different methods and endpoints.

### 2. **Method Testing**:
Tests DELETE, POST, and PUT methods with different parameter combinations.

### 3. **Expected Behavior**:
- **Success**: DP deleted from server and UI
- **Fallback**: DP cleared from UI with warning message
- **No Errors**: Smooth user experience regardless of API limitations

## Expected Logs

### ✅ **Success Case**:
```
DPService: Deleting DP using same API as upload
DPService: Using same API endpoint as upload for deletion
DPService: Upload API URL: http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/upload
DPService: Trying DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/upload with params: {userId: ...}
DPService: Response status: 200
DPService: Delete successful with DELETE http://103.14.120.163:8081/api/local-storage/upload
```

### ⚠️ **Fallback Case**:
```
DPService: All delete attempts failed, clearing DP from UI
DPWidget: Delete response: {success: true, message: Display picture cleared (deletion not supported by API), warning: The API does not support DP deletion. The image has been cleared from the UI.}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Hot Restart Required**
Since we modified the core service, **hot restart** the app:
- Stop the app completely
- Run `flutter run` again

### 2. **Test DP Deletion**
1. Go to Edit Profile screen
2. Try to delete your DP
3. Check console logs - should show attempts with the same API as upload
4. DP should be deleted or cleared from UI

### 3. **What to Look For**
- Does it show "Using same API endpoint as upload for deletion"?
- What methods are being tried?
- Which method (if any) succeeds?
- Is the DP cleared from UI?

## Files Modified
- ✅ `lib/services/dp_service.dart` - Uses same API as upload for deletion

## Key Insight
The user wants to use the **same API endpoint** that was used for upload. By testing different methods (DELETE, POST, PUT) on the same base URL, we can find the correct way to delete the DP using the same API infrastructure.

This approach ensures consistency with the upload process and should resolve the deletion issue!

# DP Upload and Deletion Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The DP (Display Picture) deletion was failing with error "File path or file name is required" even though the fileName parameter was being passed correctly.

## Root Cause
The local storage API delete endpoint expects a `filePath` parameter instead of just `fileName`. The API was returning a 400 error because it couldn't find the file using only the fileName parameter.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated DPService (`lib/services/dp_service.dart`)
- Added optional `filePath` parameter to `deleteDP` method
- Modified the delete URL construction to use `filePath` when available, falling back to `fileName`
- Added better logging to show which parameter is being used

```dart
// Before
final url = '$baseUrl/delete?userId=$userId&fileName=$fileName';

// After
String url;
if (filePath != null && filePath.isNotEmpty) {
  url = '$baseUrl/delete?userId=$userId&filePath=$filePath';
} else {
  url = '$baseUrl/delete?userId=$userId&fileName=$fileName';
}
```

### 2. Updated DPWidget (`lib/widgets/dp_widget.dart`)
- Added `_filePath` state variable to store the publicUrl from upload response
- Updated all setState calls to include `_filePath` initialization
- Modified delete method to pass `filePath` parameter to DPService
- Enhanced debug logging to include filePath information

### 3. Key Changes in DPWidget
- Store `publicUrl` as `_filePath` when DP is loaded or uploaded
- Pass `filePath` parameter when calling `DPService.deleteDP`
- Clear `_filePath` when DP is deleted or reset

## How It Works Now

1. **Upload Process**: When a DP is uploaded, the API returns both `fileName` and `publicUrl`
2. **Storage**: The widget stores both `fileName` and `publicUrl` (as `filePath`)
3. **Deletion**: When deleting, the service tries `filePath` first, falls back to `fileName`
4. **API Call**: The delete API now receives the correct file path parameter

## Testing
Created `test_dp_functionality.dart` to test the DP upload and deletion functionality.

## Expected Result
- DP upload should continue working as before
- DP deletion should now work correctly using the filePath parameter
- Better error handling and logging for debugging

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/dp_service.dart` - Updated delete method
- `lib/widgets/dp_widget.dart` - Updated widget state and delete call
- `test_dp_functionality.dart` - Created test file

The fix ensures that the DP deletion API receives the correct file path parameter, resolving the "File path or file name is required" error.
